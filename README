Fork of dwm 
~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
Implements basic features for the average day user (me) and IS a bit bloated compared to default dwm
Keybinds are personal preferance
 .______________.
 | Requirements |
 .-~-~-~-~-~-~-~.
    Optional (requires some modifications):
        pactl (can be changed)
        brightnessctl (can be changed)
        scrot (can be changed)
   .________________.
   | Xlib Installed |
   .~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-.
 .______________.
 | Installation |
 .-~-~-~-~-~-~-~.
    Optional:
        Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
        the /usr/local namespace by default).
        Edit your ~/.bashrc to alias make clean install ex: alias ccmk="sudo make clean install"

    Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm:
       ._________________________.
       | sudo make clean install |
       .~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~.

 ._____________.
 | Running dwm |
 .~-~-~-~-~-~-~.
    Optional:
        exec picom &

    Add the following line at the end your ~/.xinitrc to start the wm using startx:
        .__________.
        | exec dwm |
        .~-~-~-~-~-.

    In order to connect you WM to a specific display, make sure that
    the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

        DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

    (This will start the WM on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

 ._______________.
 | Configuration |
 .~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~.
    Configuration can be done by modifying config.def.h (base config)
    However you can modify config.h alone, I would only recommend this for non-release personal projects.
    and (re)compiling the source code.

Notes :3
You are intented to use the monocle layout over tiled/floating
